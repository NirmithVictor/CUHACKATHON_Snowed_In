Project Description:

This project is based on the health hack app.  Where me and my fellow team mates had come together and developed a web application which can help people of modern day who
might be wondering whether they are feeling alone, depressed or the fear of being infected with COVID-19.

We also developed a fitness page where people can come and view and even try out the exercises for different types of the muscle.

Functionality:
It works perfectly on a monitor and a tablet like device.
The navbar collapses when you change the screen size thereby enabling the user to access the menu at whatever page they might be on.
The forms will evaluate and give you a personalized result based on your specific needs.
The fitness icon is avilable for both beginners and intermediate gym-lovers who are eager to work on their body.
The contact us page will connect you to one of us.
The about us icon will take you to the section stating our main mission/ideals.
